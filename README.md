SPORTS PREDCTION
    Machine learning (ML) is one of the intelligent methodologies that have shown promising results in the domains of classification 
    and prediction. One of the expanding areas necessitating good predictive accuracy is sport prediction, due to the large monetary
    amounts involved in betting. In addition, club managers and owners are striving for classification models so that they can understand 
    and formulate strategies needed to win matches. These models are based on numerous factors involved in the games, such as the results
    of historical matches, player performance indicators, and opposition information. This paper provides a critical analysis of the literature
     to sport results prediction. In doing so, we identify the learning of predicting sport results. 
    
    INTRODUCTION
    Nowadays, the team managers and analysts give a prediction about who is going to win the match. In the present, different 
statistics are used for the prediction of football match result. The prediction of any cricket match is done by using some of 
the previous data. The prediction of the match depends on different variables like player stats, team stats; past data etc. 
which is used by club directors and managers to decide which team is going to win the match and what will be required to win 
the match. 

CONCLUSION
    Considering the popularity of sports in the current world, many organization disburse large funds to gain better results in 
sports matches. Therefore, predicting the game results is now a subject of interest for different sports organizations. We 
implemented the model using different machine learning algorithms and were able to reach the accuracy with 
Random Forest Algorithm on the Match History Database of one year along with the Team vs. Team Database. Referring to 
related works, there are a lot of improvements that can be made to our system for improving the accuracy of both, match result 
prediction as well as score prediction. We can also use the Machine Learning for the runs Scorer prediction.
